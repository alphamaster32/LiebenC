# LiebenC

LiebenC is an toy C standard library implementation aimed at freestanding or embedded environments.

## Inspiration

LiebenC draws heavy inspiration from:

- **musl libc** — for header implementations and design choices.
- **Zig's std library** — for crt0 and start function implementations.

## Goals

- Provide a lightweight, understandable C library 
- Remain easy to integrate into non-traditional toolchains
- Support experimentation, education, and custom-OS development

---

Contributions, questions, and experimentation are pretty much welcome.
